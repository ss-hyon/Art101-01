		<h2> Challenges </h2>
    <p>This lab was not as challenging as beginning to learn how to code functions.
			With some personal practice I was able to understand the material taught in class.
		I believe that creating scripts just takes trial and error to make the functions testing to
	work properly. The biggiest challenge so far is learning the correct terms when formulating
	the scripts.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I didn't have much problem in this lab. I was able to complete the first couple tasks quickly once understanding
			 the material. I was able to use w3schools as reference whenever I needed more explaination on the
		 process of formulating a function.</p>
