	<h2> Lab 13: Loops </h2>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p> Throughout the lab, may partner and I did not have any problems in the main tasks of the lab.
		We were able to get the JavaScript file working without any errors when double
		checking through Console.
	</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p> One of the problems I faced in this lab was styling the output of the Javascript.
	I was able to experiment with the numerical output and had an order list to be the
outputting id to create a list. After some trial and error, with the help of my
partner we were able to figure out how to input the correct tags.</p>
