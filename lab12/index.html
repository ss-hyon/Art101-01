	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p> I believe that the most challenging part of completing this lab was remembering
		the correct tag lines to reference back in JavaScript. The lecture notes and
		recorded lessons was very useful in guiding how to create conditional functions
		using codes form jQuery.</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p> I ran into an error when checking my work in console. However, my partner
		was able to scan over my work, helping me troubleshoot the problem. After a couple
		revisions, we able to find the problem to my output text not appearing after
		clicking the button.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p> In the end I was able to create a functional button, using condtional functions
		and jQuery. Here are the results:
	<div class="output">
	<h2> Find Out Your Hogwarts House!</h2>
	<p> Please enter your name </p>
<input type="text"  id="input">
<button id="button">Submit</button>
<div id="output"> </div>
