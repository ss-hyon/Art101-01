	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p> In lab 16 we practiced inputting the wanted data from our API endpoint, to
		display in the output div content. This lab focused on creating and finding
		the correct tags to code into our JavaScript files.
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p> There were a few inconvineces that resulted in hours of troubleshooting.
	 The amount of knowledge required to have everything run correctly is incomparable
	 to my own skills. Due to this I made many syntax errors to appear that disrupted
	 the flow of my functions.</p>
	 <h1>Results</h2>
		<p> In the end my partner was able to help me see my mistakes and guided me
			to create a more organized coding structure.</p>
