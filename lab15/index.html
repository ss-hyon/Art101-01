<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>The challenge of this lab to create a JavaScript event button listener using api
endpoints and ajax. In this lab we took endpoints from an online api source and implement
the data recevied to our webpage.</p>
<h1>Problems</h1>
<p>Some of the problems I faced when completing the lab was figuring out how to get
the output of the api endpoint onto the output div content. I was able to get the
functions to work, but after troubleshooting with my partner, we were able to solve
the outputting html code to gather the data from the correct source.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p> The result of this lab was creating a event listener button that generates ideas
to do when you are bored. </br>
Click on the button to generate something to do when you are bored!</P>
