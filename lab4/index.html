<h1> Psuedocoding</h1>
	<p> In this lab we learn to create a psuedocode list.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>There were no major challenges, other than think of ways to simplify the game
	for the psudocode list. My partner (Elan) and I were able to list the basic funtions
	of the game and from there we were able to determine the listing.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>There were no problems with this lab, but I was able to learn a few shortcut keys
		from my partner to make coding in atom faster and easier.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
