<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>Lab 10 focused on the element functions of events and forms in JavaScript.
The lab had many difficult properties that I did not understand, so I had a harder
time completeting the assignment. After reviewing the recorded lectures I was able to
go through the process of task 2. </p>
<h1>Problems</h1>
<p>One issue I had with this lab was figuring out how to connected the sorted
function to show up as the output. After carfully inspecting my work and comparing
my work with my partner's, I was able to catch my error. My error was forgetting to
delare the new variable with the proper tags.</p> </div>
<div id= "results">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>In the end, I was able to complete this assignment, but I suspect
that I need a little more practice with all the new element tags. </p>
	<h2>Script Input</h2>
	<label>Input your name:</label>
	<input type="input" id="user-name">
	<button id="my-button">Submit</button> </br>
