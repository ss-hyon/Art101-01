<h1>Lab 3 File structures and Transfers</h1>
<p>The idea of lab 3 was to put to practice of all that we have learn so far in HTML and CSS coding.
	In this lab, we had to create an index.html file and structure the document accordingly.
<h2>Difficulties:</h2>
<p>Some of the difficulties that I have encountered so far in coding is learning what tag does what funtion.
	<br> After a couple hours of practice, I can easily identify the basics of css and html codes.
	<br> Any other problems can be solved by a little research.
<h2>Results:</h2>
  짜잔~ Well here are the results to hours of practice</p>
