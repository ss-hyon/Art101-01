		<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>This lab was a challenging lab because of the new material we are learning.
				I am still getting familiar with the console term input, but will get better
			once after practicing a bit more.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>My problem when working on this lab was inputing the ownIt variable as a boolean.
				I was not too sure about the formation of the input, other than what was on the lecture notes.
			There was a mistake in my part of forgetting to add the semicolon and not spacing out "var" before inputting
			"ownIt".</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> In the end I was able to figure out my problem by troubleshooting the issue with my partner.</p>
