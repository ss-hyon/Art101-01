	<h1>Arrays and Objects</h1>
	In lab 6 we learned about declaring arrays and objects as variables in Console and Javascript.
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Some of the challenge was figuring out which coding works for either array or objects.
			In lecture, we have learned: [] are for arrays, {}- are for objects, and ()- are for
		functions. Differentiating between is important for the programming to work properly.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My problem when working on this lab was console logging the object data list. When inputting
		the similar contents as "console.log("My Wheels: " + myTransport);" for objects,
		the results shows [object object]. To fix this, I was able to research the problem through
	online sources to troubleshoot the problem.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Overall my problems were able to be solved through researching online
	source. In my reserach, I have found "console.log('My object: ', obj);" to fix my
issues on Console. This is because you must only log the object; using the comma would output
the first line the string, and then the object would be rendered.</p>
